ðŸ”¹ Improvements to Revisit in Future Versions
These are the areas we discussed but will not implement in Version 1. We'll revisit them once the first iteration is stable.

âœ… 1. Multi-Asset & Multi-Timeframe Testing (Improvement 1)
ðŸ”¹ Current Approach (V1):

Backtesting only supports one currency pair at a time.

Strategy logic is applied only to a single timeframe (5 min).

ðŸ”¹ Future Improvement:

Allow multi-asset backtesting (run the same strategy on multiple pairs simultaneously).

Enable multi-timeframe confirmations (e.g., using 1-hour & 4-hour charts for trend direction while entering trades on a 5-min chart).

âœ… 2. Interactive Visualizations & Reports (Improvement 2)
ðŸ”¹ Current Approach (V1):

Performance metrics are logged in CSV files.

Basic plots like PnL, equity curve, and drawdown are static.

ðŸ”¹ Future Improvement:

Interactive trade visualization using Plotly or Dash.

Ability to replay trades on historical charts.

Generate automated PDF reports for each backtest session.

âœ… 3. Partial Take-Profits & Trailing Stops
ðŸ”¹ Current Approach (V1):

Full position is closed at either TP (Take Profit) or SL (Stop Loss).

No scaling out of trades or dynamic SL adjustments.

ðŸ”¹ Future Improvement:

Allow partial exits (e.g., exit 50% at 1R, move SL to breakeven).

Implement trailing stops (e.g., move SL after price moves favorably).

âœ… 4. Advanced Position Sizing
ðŸ”¹ Current Approach (V1):

Strategy defines fixed risk per trade (e.g., 1% of capital).

ðŸ”¹ Future Improvement:

Implement dynamic position sizing based on:

ATR-based sizing (volatility-adjusted lot sizes).

Kelly Criterion or optimal f methods.

Monte Carlo simulations to test risk models.

âœ… 5. Dynamic Slippage & Variable Spread Modeling
ðŸ”¹ Current Approach (V1):

Assumes fixed spread (e.g., 0.1 pips).

ðŸ”¹ Future Improvement:

Introduce variable spread based on historical market conditions.

Add slippage models to simulate real execution conditions.

âœ… 6. Strategy Optimization & Walk-Forward Testing
ðŸ”¹ Current Approach (V1):

Uses static strategy parameters for backtesting.

ðŸ”¹ Future Improvement:

Implement grid search or genetic algorithms to optimize strategy parameters.

Introduce walk-forward testing (test optimized parameters on unseen data).
